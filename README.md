# Danbooru-comparator-script

A script that my "friend" made me write for him to check on the number of smut to nonsmut artworks on danbooru. I don't want anything to do with this after this.
Modify the script as needed, it's really easy to.
For those who still don't understand it, just copy the elif to the next elif, change the number, the words that correspond to the new set you want, and a new text file containing all the names of the characters.currently limited to 9 digits, but can be changed.
