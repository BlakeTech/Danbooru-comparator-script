# Danbooru-comparator-script

A script that my "friend" made me write for him to check on the number of smut to nonsmut artworks on danbooru. I don't want anything to do with this after this.

Modify the script as needed, it's really easy to.

For those who still don't understand it, just copy the elif to the next elif, change the number, the words that correspond to the new set you want, and a new text file containing all the names of the characters.

Everything you need is inside the Complete folder, along with some sample files.
The executing script is Main, modify this for more options.
nameurl is just the variables that will change. I.e. for example, in Kantai, there are 235 ships, thus the link changes by name, and is what changes in the script.
Options1 is literally just used to make the script look smaller. It holds the options for the initial selection.
Selectiontemplate is just used when you want to add new options in. Modify the weird bits to suit your needs.
